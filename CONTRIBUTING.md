## Code of Conduct

Before contributing, please read our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/CodeXtecch/grow-geeky/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating in this project, you agree to abide by its terms.

## How Can I Contribute?
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. When you're ready to create a pull request, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2. Set up the development environment by following the instructions in the [README](https://github.com/CodeXtecch/grow-geeky/blob/main/README.md).
3. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!



### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug in the source code, you can help us by submitting an issue to our GitHub repository. If you can provide a fix, it would be even better!

### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancements are always welcome. Before you suggest a new feature or enhancement, please check the [issues](https://github.com/CodeXtecch/grow-geeky/issues) to see if it has already been suggested. If not, feel free to submit a new issue.

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to GrowGeeky? You can start by looking through these beginner and help-wanted issues:

- Beginner issues - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- Help wanted issues - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues.

## Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.
